                <h3>About Donsol</h3>
                <p>
                    Donsol is a coastal municipality in the province of Sorsogon, in the Bicol Region of Luzon, Philippines. It covers about 156.20 km² and has a population of approximately 50,281 as of the 2020 census. It’s often dubbed the “Whale Shark Capital of the Philippines”, thanks to the large numbers of gentle whale sharks (locally called butanding) that visit its waters. 
                </p>
