                <h3>About Banaue Rice Terraces</h3>
                <p>
                    The mountainous Banaue in Ifugao province located in the northern part of Luzon has captured the interest of both local and international travelers because of its rich culture, cool weather, untouched mountain ranges and the warmth of the local Ifugao people. The Banaue Rice Terraces, often referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," are a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of the Ifugao people who carved these terraces into the mountains over 2,000 years ago using traditional methods passed down through generations. These terraces are not only a marvel of engineering but also a symbol of the Ifugao's deep connection to their land and culture.

                <li><b>By Bus From Manila:</b></li>
                    <p> Traveling from Manila to Banaue (Ifugao province) is exclusively by land transportation, with no direct flights available; the trip takes approximately 9 hours, highly dependent on traffic. Most visitors prefer to travel at night to arrive early and maximize their time exploring Banaue. You have two main bus options: Ohayami Bus Transit, located at the corner of Fajardo Street and Lacson Avenue in Sampaloc, Manila, offers a daily trip leaving at 9:00 PM and allows online booking for reservations. Alternatively, Dangwa Transit, with a terminal in Cubao, operates only one trip daily departing around 8:00 PM and accommodates passengers on a first-come, first-served basis, so early arrival is essential.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>By Bus From Baguio:</b>
                    <p> The bus from Baguio to Banaue takes approximately 3 hours including transfers and departs at least three times a day. You can go by Ohayami Bus transit stationed along Otek Street near Burnham Park or KMS bus that offers two trips daily and can be found near Rizal Park.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>By Bus From Sagada:</b>
                    <p> If you’re coming from Sagada, it’s advisable to get to the terminal early. At the Sagada Municipal Hall, there are jeepneys going to Bontoc (the capital of Mountain Province). Travel time is around an hour and the trip starts as early as 6:30 a.m. There’s an available trip that leaves every half hour until 9:00 a.m to 1 p.m. 

                        From Bontoc, you can take the local bus to Banaue. The first trip leaves at 7:00 a.m and takes around 2 hours. Another option is to ride a van that leaves at 8:30 a.m., 10:00 a.m., and 1:00 p.m.</p>

            <h2><i class ="fa-solid fa-bus"></i>Tourism and Development</h2>
        
                <p>Tourism in Banaue centers on the ancient rice terraces, a UNESCO World Heritage site known as the "8th Wonder of the World," which draws visitors for scenic views and trekking. Development is a key issue, with concerns that tourism may be harming the terraces, while also being a potential engine for a more sustainable local economy and culture. Initiatives like the DOT-CAR's support for golf tourism suggest efforts to diversify and grow the industry in the region</p>

            <p>The best months to visit Banaue are during the months of April to May and October to November since these are the times when the rice terraces are at their greenest and most scenic state.

                Visiting during the rainy seasons of July and August is not recommended due to the possibility of landslides in some areas making it difficult for activities like hiking and trekking.</p>
