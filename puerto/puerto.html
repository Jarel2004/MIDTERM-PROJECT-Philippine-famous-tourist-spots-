            <p>To visit the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, you’ll first need to make your way to Puerto Princesa City, the vibrant capital of the island province of Palawan. You can get to Puerto Princesa by land, sea, or air. The most convenient and quickest option is to book flights to Puerto Princesa City, which is easily accessible from major cities across the Philippines.

                Once you’ve arrived in Puerto Princesa CIty, the next step is to travel to Sabang, a small village located north of the city and the gateway to the Underground River. Head to San Jose Terminal to catch a jeepney, bus, or van to Sabang village, a journey that typically takes two to three hours.      </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>By Jeepney or Bus</b></li>
                    <p> To get to Sabang village by jeepney or bus, head to the San Jose Terminal, located at the San Jose New Market in Puerto Princesa City. From the terminal, you'll find jeepneys and non-air-conditioned buses that make their way to Sabang Port. Scheduled departure times are 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM.

                        Jeepneys and buses typically wait until all seats are filled before departing.The journey usually takes around 1.5 to 2 hours, with travel time ranging from two to three hours, including stopovers along the way.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>By Van</b>
                    <p>Another option for reaching Sabang village is by van, which offers a faster, more comfortable ride. These vans make the trip in about two hours or less, providing a quicker and more direct route compared to jeepneys or buses.

                        Upon reaching Sabang Port, you'll need to present your permit at the Tourism Office and pay the environmental and boat fees, along with the mandatory audio guide. A designated boat will then take you to the Underground River's entrance, where you'll switch to a smaller paddle boat for the cave tour.        </p>
